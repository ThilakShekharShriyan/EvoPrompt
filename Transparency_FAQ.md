# EvoPrompt's Responsible AI FAQ

## What is EvoPrompt?

* EvoPrompt generates and optimizes effective prompts with efficient performance on various tasks automatically by integrating evolutionary algorithms and LLMs. 
* Starting from initial population composed of several prompts, EvoPrompt optimizes the population iteratively by evlutionary algorithms, e.g., genetic algorithms and differential evolution algorithms.

## What can EvoPrompt do?

* EvoPrompt generates effective diecrete prompts automatically used for diverse LLMs (either open-source or black-box), such as Alpaca, ChatGPT, etc. 
* There is no need for any internal parameters or gradients and it does not  bring any training computational costs. 
* Prompts generated EvoPrompt are human-readable, interpretable and can be directly used as input for APIs. 

## What is / are EvoPrompt's intended use(s)?

- Users who call black-box LLM APIs, those who utilize ChatGPT to implement certain tasks, the performance of which is highly sensitive to the prompts or instructions. 

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of EvoPrompt?

- Users can set parameters such as the size of the population, the number of iterative steps since there exists a trade-off between the cost and the performance.
